*Floating timer to track time taken to solve questions while preparing for competitive or other exams.
*Very Simple and Mininal app with very small size and open source without any trackers.
*Verify integrity, verify official origin, unmodification, tempering detection, modding via matching above publickey-hash/certificate values which is from my own private key signing certificate that I personally uses while releasing/publishing official build/signing.
*Future releases of this app and all other app created by me will also be digitally signed with same certificate/publickey-hash values given above, until I don't forgot password for my private signing key. Updated installation over existing installed app on android platform allowed only when both apks are signed by same key.
*If certificate/publickey-hash value of your apk file doesn't match to value given above that means you are using modded/tempered app and not made/build/released by me and it may contain viruses, malwares, other malacious things. Digital signature becomes invalid even when binary/code/dex of apk/any file altered/changed in any way. No one can sign any/modified/temper apk with the same signature as of my with above certificate/publickey value exact, except me bcz only i have private key for that public key certificate and can be used only by me for signing purpose.
*To verify and view signature/certificate you can use JDK in Linux/window or Apk Analyzer/apk certificate info/apk signature verification app on play store.
